# About Me

A midlife guy, a dad with a regular 9 to 5 job. Work for the past 15 years as business intelligence consultant. At the age of midlife and having sign of midlife crisis, I started to think of something which I could do to be more secured and confident moving forward. No idea what could happen in the future but felt that it is better safe than sorry to try on something new to pick up and learn new skill. And if I happened to fail in my pursuit, at least I would have picked up some useful skills in the process.

I had no clear idea what a data scientist was and why it was an important role. Immersed in a dead-end job in an multinational company, I had started to forget all of the stuff I had learned through the many difficult years of my education. I am not sure what triggered my resolve to look into the matter more, but I do remember coming to the realization that this was my life's vocation.

I have started and not sure how long it could take ... eating the elephant one bite at a time.
