# Setting up Python

Python or R and I have chosen Python as it is much more easier to learn (that's what I read online). Before you get started, you will need to setup python environment.

* Install eclipse, platform runtime binary only (http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/)
* Install Pydev plugin, an IDE built on the Eclipse platform (http://www.pydev.org/download.html)
* Install anaconda to get all essential python libraries (numpy, scipy and scikit-learn and etc) (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
