  Hong Kong is a hotbed of entrepreneurial innovation, with technology start-ups
  in the limelight. And while the fields of e-commerce, financial technology and
  information technology sectors dominate among the nearly 2,000 start-ups
  estimated in the city by InvestHK's most recent survey (as of August 2016),
  new businesses engaged in property technology - or Proptech - have been
  quietly growing.
