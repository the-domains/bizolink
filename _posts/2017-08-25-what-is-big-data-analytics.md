# What is Big Data Analytics

According to WhatIs.com, big data analytics is the process of examining large and varied data sets, such as big data, to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences and other useful information that can help organizations make more informed business decisions.

Driven by specialized analytics systems and software, big data analytics can point the way to various business benefits, including new revenue opportunities, more effective marketing, better customer service, improved operational efficiency and competitive advantages over rivals.

Big Data Analytics applications enable data scientists,predictive modelers,statisticians and other analytics professionals to analyse growing volumes of structured transactions data, plus other forms of data that are often left untapped by conventional business intelligence (BI) and analytics programs.

That encompasses a mix of semi-structured and unstructured data. These include internet clickstream data,web server logs, social media content, text responses, mobile-phone call-detail records and machine data captured by sensors connected to the internet of things.
