# Digging into Big Data

Hey! welcome to analytics tao!  
After months of reading and browsing websites for information about data scientist, I finally came up with an idea to setup about blog to log what did learn and hopefully it can help others as well during my journey to become a data scientist.

Following are the list of item I begin with:-

* Register Kaggle and explore what is it all about, still wondering how to participate contest.
* No knowledge about what Python is all about, started reading Python for Data Analysis.
* Started a blog to log progress and sharing.
